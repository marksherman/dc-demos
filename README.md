# Digital Citizenship Demos

Demos developed for Digital Citizenship class, COMP 1000 at [Emmanuel College](https://www.emmanuel.edu/)


## Imager

<https://marksherman.dev/imager/>

A simple toy to explore how images are stored digitally. This demonstration lets you play with bit depth to see how nuance is introduced with more bits of color resolution.

Pick a shade from what's available at the selected bit depth, and click on a pixel to paint it!

The text display below the image shows a rudimentary text representation of the image. This is *one* possible way to represent the information of the image as text. As you hover over pixels in the image, the corresponding value will be highlighted in the text display.

## Purpose

This repository is for demo ideas I’ve had while teaching Digital Citizenship. I’m hoping to get them all in one place, so it will be easy for me and others to use them with their students. All educators are invited to link directly to these demos as part of lessons, lectures, or class work, but please abide by the open source license: you must give credit, provide a link to the source, and publish any changes or derivative works under the same license. I chose the GNU AGPL 3.0 license as this content may be used “over a network” as its means of distribution, and is a strong copyleft.

Examines sociological impacts of these technologies, including culture, politics, and economics. Explores and discusses what a person needs to know and do to be a responsible member of Internet society.

### Learning Goals

•        Learn skills and theory of data privacy and personal security.

•        Construct informed arguments about Digital Citizenship-related topics

## About Me

I’m Mark Sherman, the first professor of computer science at Emmanuel College. I got my BS, MS, and PhD at UMass Lowell, the latter two while working with the *Engaging Computing Group* studying computer science education. I did postdoc work studying computing education at MIT with the [App Inventor](https://appinventor.mit.edu/) group. At Emmanuel College I founded and served as director of the *Integrated Digital and Data Sciences Initiative* (IDDS). With the help of the IDDS committe, we built a minor in Data Analytics, a major and minor in Computer Science, and advanced the presence, discussion, and integration of computing into the liberal arts environment of the college.
